# README: üìö Academic Dockerized Books-Store - Online Demo

## üß≠ Introduction

This is a containerized full-stack web application deployed via Docker. It simulates a university marketplace where users - whether affiliated with the university or not - can buy and sell second-hand books. Deliveries are handled internally within the university, with no third-party logistics involved. The app is purely a demo, designed to showcase development skills in a similar context.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project consists of:

- **Front-End**: Located in the `Vite-jsx` folder, built with React and Vite.
- **Back-End**: Located in the `demo` folder, built with Java 17 and Spring. This also includes static forms and scripts for registration and authentication, integrated via Thymeleaf.

The entire application is containerized and orchestrated using Docker. There are 2 containers/services and one database PSQL.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions

To run the project locally, use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Or, depending on your Docker version:

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can adjust the docker-compose.yml file to suit your environment. This specific project is designed to run online (i.e. production mode).

## üöÄ Deployment

- **CI** is handled via GitHub Actions, with the potential to implement **CD** through the host.
- **Container images** are hosted on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
- **Deployment** is hosted on [Northflank](https://northflank.com), a PaaS optimized for Docker workflows. Live app link: [Books-Store](https://p01--frontend--ls828smnbk6x.code.run/).

### Access Levels

- **Unauthenticated users**: (A visitor) can browse a sort of full preview of the marketplace.
- **Authenticated users**: Have full access to all features, including listing and purchasing books.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a demo application. All content and functionality are illustrative and do not represent real commercial transactions, even though the model is scalable and can be updated into a finished product. To handle actual transactions, third-party services (e.g., RazorPay, Stripe, etc.) would be required.
